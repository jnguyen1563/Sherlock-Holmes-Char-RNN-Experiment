# Sherlock Holmes Char-RNN Experiment

Ran an experiment to test the modeling capabilities of various RNN architectures, as well as exploring the effect of different optimizers.

#### Architectures include:  
Vanilla RNN, LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional

#### Optimizers include:  
Adam, RMSProp

This project was created for the class FA20 COGS185 - Advanced Machine Learning Methods.  The experiment includes a report written in the style of popular machine learning conference NeurIPS.
